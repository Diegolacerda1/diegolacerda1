### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio

I am Diego de Castro, I have been working as Quality Assurance Engineer for the past 4 years, and I have expertise in both manual and automation techniques, experience in different testing methodologies such as Black Box, Gray Box, Smoke Testing, Regression testing, GUI testing. 

This is my Portfolio where you can find some personal projects I worked at to showcase my skills as a QA Automation Engineer. The tool I chose to show my abilities was Cypress. 

Some fun facts about me (if you are interested):
  - I hold a Master Degree in Sports Science that I earned from one of my most respected Universities in Russia (and I am Brazilian, and YES, I speak Russian, English, Portuguese).
  - I decided to change careers in 2020 after Covid-19 hit to be able to work remotely, build my family and raise my kids.
  - I learned how to Code within 3 months and was able to build my first Testing Automation Framework with Cypress.
  - I love surfing!
